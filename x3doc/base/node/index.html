            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>            
            Welcome to the <strong>X3DOM Node API Documentation</strong>!
            Within this documentation package, you will find detailed information about all <strong>X3DOM Nodes</strong> and their <strong>Fields</strong>.
            Within a typical X3DOM application, nodes are a regular part of the HTML DOM and can therefore also be dynamically manipulated via standard DOM scripting.            
            You may, for instance, have this HTML representation of a <code>material</code> node:
            </p>
            
            <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-html">
    &lt;material id='myMaterial' diffuseColor='1 0 0'&gt;&lt;/material&gt;
            </code></pre>
            
            <p>
            You can then access and manipulate the fields of the X3DOM node like regular HTML attributes, for example:
            </p>
            
            <pre class="prettyprint"><code class="language-js">
    var oldMaterial = document.getElementById('myMaterial').getAttribute('diffuseColor');
    console.log('The old value was ' + oldMaterial);    
    var newMaterial = document.getElementById('myMaterial').setAttribute('diffuseColor', '0 1 0');
    console.log('The new value is ' + newMaterial);
            </code></pre>
            <p>
            Since HTML attributes are not case sensitive, X3DOM attributes behave in the same way.
            You may therefore write <code>'diffuseColor'</code> as well as <code>'DiffuseColor'</code> or <code>'diffusecolor'</code>, for example.
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Please note that this part of X3DOM's documentation is intended for HTML authors and people that want to use X3DOM's standard, DOM-based interaction features.
            JavaScript properties of nodes that are not represented as fields, as well as special X3DOM-related JavaScript methods, are not part of the Node API, but listed in the 
            <a href="../full/index.html">Full API documentation</a>.
            </p>
            

            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>
            This API documentation is automatically generated during a nightly build process, using the latest available code from
            the </strong>X3DOM development branch</strong>. It is therefore intended for use with this branch of X3DOM.
            <br>
            Please note that the X3DOM API documentation project started during the development of version 1.6, therefore there is
            unfortunately no such documentation available for older versions of X3DOM.
            However, the X3DOM team will provide a proper snapshot of this documentation for each upcoming release.
            </p>
            

            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <p>
            Like in the X3D standard, X3DOM nodes are grouped into <strong>Components</strong>.
            There are several ways to find what you are looking for:

            <ul>
                <li><a href="nodes.html">Node Index</a></li>
                <li><a href="components.html">Component Index</a></li>
            </ul>

            The Node Index allows you to directly browse nodes by their name, while the Component Index
            lists all Components and provides a list of nodes for each of them.

            </p>
